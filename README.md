# Insulin Cooler

This repository is for my senior project

#### Problem Statement

There is a large population of diabetic citizens who require doses of insulin every day. Long-term portable methods of insulin storage are very expensive.

#### Methodology and Limitations

Insulin must be stored at temperatures from 36&deg;F to 46&deg;F. Using 3d printing to maximalize thermal insulation in the chassis, combined with peltier coolers, lithium-ion batteries and IOT ESP32, it should be reasonably feasible to create a cooler for under $50.

The specs I submitted for my coursework states that the cooler must have a battery life of at least 48 hours. However, I have made it a personal goal to maximize thermal efficiency to achieve two weeks or more.

Using 3d printing, I should be able to create an airgap insulation.
